1). WAP to find the smallest and most significant element stored in a dynamic array of n integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm using descending order conditions. Also, show all the possible conditions of the algorithm.

2). WAP to find the most significant number and count the occurrence of the largest number in a Dynamic Array of n integers using a single loop(Using Selection Sort). Also, print the memory locations of the largest and smallest numbers.

3). WAP to store n employeeâ€™s data such as employee name, gender, designation, department, and basic pay using Structure. Calculate the gross pay of each employee as follows:
           Gross pay = basic pay + HR + DA
           HR=25% of basic and DA=75% of basic. 
Also, solve problem 3 using by Passing Structure to a Function.
